It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres . Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training . Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world , which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art . Ballet may also refer to a ballet dance work , which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production . A well-known example of this is The Nutcracker , a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained artists . Traditional classical ballets usually are performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging , whereas modern ballets , such as the neoclassical works of American choreographer George Balanchine , often are performed in simple costumes ( e.g. , leotards and tights ) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery ."}

It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres . Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training . Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world , which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art . Ballet may also refer to a ballet dance work , which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production . A well-known example of this is The Nutcracker , a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained artists . Traditional classical ballets usually are performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging , whereas modern ballets , such as the neoclassical works of American choreographer George Balanchine , often are performed in simple costumes ( e.g. , leotards and tights ) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery ."}
